  <p>Tongkat Fitness will take appropriate legal, organizational, and technical measures to protect your personal information consistent with applicable privacy and data security laws. When Tongkat Fitness uses a third-party service provider including a Service Partner, that provider
  will be carefully selected and required to use appropriate measures to protect the confidentiality and security of personal information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your PII from unauthorised access, use
  or disclosure. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet or a mobile phone network connection is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your PII, we cannot guarantee the security of the PII you transmit
  to our websites: any transmission is at your own risk. While we cannot guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration to data will not occur, once we have received your information, we will employ appropriate technical security measures to prevent such
  unfortunate occurrences.</p>
  <h2>Links to other websites</h2>
  <p>Our website may contain links to other websites of interest. However, once you have used these links to leave our site, you should note that we do not have any control over that other website. Therefore, we cannot be responsible for the protection and
